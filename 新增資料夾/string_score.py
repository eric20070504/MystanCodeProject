------------------------------
This program calculates a score for a given string based on
the types of characters it contains.

Digits are worth 1 point, uppercase letters are worth 2 points,
and lowercase letters are worth 3 points. The score() function
iterates through each character in the string, adds up the
corresponding points, and prints the final total score.
